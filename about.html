## About

At Wine pEaring, we believe the experience of wine tasting is enhanced by the addition of music. We also believe it's an experience that should be shared among loved ones. A typical wine club will send you a package of wines once a month. We take this to the next level in two ways. We send two packages, one to you and one to a loved one near or far. Have a son or daughter at college in a different state? How about a sibling, as far as across the country or as near as down the street? One subscription comes with shipping to two addresses simultaneously, so no matter the distance you can enjoy it together. Additionally, with each wine shipment comes a music playlist curated to pair well with the wines we send you.

Wine undoubtedly stimulates 4 of the 5 senses on its' own. Taste, smell, touch, and sight are all covered by the wine itself. But at Wine pEaring we believe the vibrations and mood set by music enhances each wine uniquely. Sign up to experience it for yourself!
